			I am a senior Research Scientist in the Sea AI Lab of the Sea group. Before, I worked in Salesforce as a research scientist from 2019 to 2021.  I completed my Ph.D. degree in 2019 at the National University of Singapore (NUS), fortunately advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/">Prof. Jiashi Feng</a> and <a href="https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/"> Prof. Shuicheng Yan</a>. Before studying in NUS, I graduated from Peking University (PKU) in 2016 and during this period, I was fortunately directed by <a href="http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/zlin/zlin.htm"> Prof. Zhouchen Lin</a> and <a href="http://www.cis.pku.edu.cn/faculty/vision/zhangchao/zhangchao.htm"> Prof. Chao Zhang</a> in <a href="https://zero-lab-pku.github.io/"> ZERO Lab</a>. During the research period, I also work closely with <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/xtyuan1980/"> Prof. Xiaotong Yuan</a>. I also spend several wonderful months in 2018 at Georgia Tech as visiting student hosted by <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/huan-xu/"> Prof. Huan Xu</a>.
